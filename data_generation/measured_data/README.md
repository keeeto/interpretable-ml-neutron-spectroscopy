# Measured data

This folder should contain the measured INS data for the work _Interpretable, calibrated neural networks for analysis and understanding of neutron spectra_.
These files are too large to be stored in a git repository, however, and are instead available at: [10.5281/zenodo.4088240](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4088240).
Please download that archive and place the files with `.sqw` extensions in this folder.
