# interpretable-ml-neutron-spectroscopy
A repository of code associated with the publication _Interpretable, calibrated neural networks for analysis and understanding of neutron spectra_

Data associated with traing the neural networks in this repo is available at **10.5281/zenodo.4088240**

## Running the codes

There are different `conda` environments associated with the different codes:

* To run the uncertainty quntification netowrks you will need to load the `pytorch` environment in `environment-torch.yml`
* To run the discrimination and class activation map networksyou will need to load the `tensorflow` environment in `environment-tf.yml`
